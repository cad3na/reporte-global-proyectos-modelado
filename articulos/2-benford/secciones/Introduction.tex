The purpose of this document is to present the results of simulations and experiments regarding the implementation of a physical dynamical system, in this case, an autonomous electronic circuit made in order to look for Benford's Law conformity of a physical quantity. 
The circuits that were chosen for this objective have various regions of operation and can be easily regulated, so an important amount of experiments and simulations were performed.
Conformity to Benford's Law was achieved, and the circumstances under which the satisfactory results were obtained are also described in this document.
