\emph{Chaos} is aperiodic long-term behavior in a determinisic system that exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions \cite{Strogatz14}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Aperiodic long-term behavior} means that there are trajectories which do not settle down to fixed points, periodic orbits, or quasiperiodic orbits as $t$->$\inf$.
\item \emph{Deterministic} means that the system has no random or noisy inputs or parameters. The irregular behavior arises from the system's nonlinearity, rather than from noisi driving forces.
\item \emph{Sensitive dependence on initial conditions} means that nearby trajectories separate exponentially fast, i.e., that the system has a positive Lyapunov Exponent
\end{itemize}
