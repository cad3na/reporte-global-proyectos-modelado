Taking note of the model of two bars and 6 elements we know that the equilibrium conditions are equal force densities in each string, so we can conclude that a simple way of modelling a body with axial symetry is to asume that all the bars have the same size, the mass center of the bar is located in it's geometric center and the mass distribution is uniform, the inertial reference frame is at the origin of the positions, the friction between the rod and the string is null.

Also noting that the microtubules behave basically as rods and microfilaments as strings, we can conclude that a cell can be modelled as a class 1 tensegrity without restrictions, remaining to investigate the number of rods and strings best suited for the cell.
